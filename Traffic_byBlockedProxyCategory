#The goal of this panel is to spot users repeatedly visiting dhosts that are on a block category list and OR deemed not appropriate for "reasonable personal use" outlined in #acceptable use policy. The dashboard is setup with a panel for action=blocked as well as action=allowed. It then counts the number of dhosts visited that meet the query criteria. #Ideally an analyst will check this daily for past 24 hour hits and weekly to spot repeat offenders/suspicious events. 


#if Proxy does not block by default- it would be useful to create one where action=allowed action=droped etc.

#Exempt destination hosts as fit for your enviroment, this will take some time to come up with a complete list
